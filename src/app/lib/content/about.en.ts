      "I'm a backend developer passionate about **system design**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **automation**. I build scalable APIs, implement Infrastructure as Code, and design reliable, maintainable systems that support growth. My main stack includes **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, **PostgreSQL**, **Docker**, and **Linux**. I'm also a long-time Linux user - always experimenting with setups and optimizing environments to make development faster and cleaner.
